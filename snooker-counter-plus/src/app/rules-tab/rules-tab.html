      <ion-text>
        Snooker is played with fifteen object balls that are not numbered and are solid red (called reds), six object balls of other colors that are not numbered (called colors in snooker) and a cue ball (called the white ball).
        The aim of snooker is to pocket the balls legally according to the rules and to score a greater number of points than the opponent.
        Point values for object balls: red-1, yellow-2, green-3, brown-4, blue-5, pink-6, black-7.
